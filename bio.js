Leah Ruisenor is a Computer Science student at the University of Washington Tacoma, who will be graduating in the summer of 2018.
            After graduating from high school in 1999 she began pursuing a degree in Psychology from Louisiana Tech University, but after
            spending two years in the study she realized that her true interest in the subject was how humans processed information, moreover
            it was processing that had captivated her. Intrigued by how the interpretation of various stimuli could
            generate different actions in different people, caused her to change educational focuses and fueled her passion for user interface
            design. While in-between studies she held a position as a designated window display designer for the Gap; while unconventional it
            allowed her to practice the craft of designing and targeting for audience interactions. Putting to work a few of the methodologies
            learned from her studies, she was able to design window displays that attracted the attention of and drew in new customers through
            brilliantly designed stimuli. Being part of a military family made staying in one place difficult and over her travels from state
            to state she honed her design skills to create delectable treats for children, eventually forming a small business creating one off
            smash cakes. Driven by her love for design, she would pick customers brains, drawing detailed sketches and plans that ultimately
            led to small masterpieces. While she has always been artistic, it is her passion in the service of pleasing customers that truly
            comes out in her works. Eventually she found herself in Washington State and with the closing of her familyâ€™s military commitment
            she made this her home and returned to her education, with a focus on her passion of designing for human interaction. Presently
            she is enrolled in the University of Washington Tacoma and has been actively pursuing a Computer Science Degree with plans to graduate
            in the summer of 2018. Leah has the soul of an artist and the heart of a techie; designing front-end programs that are fun and exciting
            for the end user allows her to combine both worlds.
