        <p class="w3-center"><em>My story</em></p>
        <p>Leah Ruisenor is a Computer Science student at the University of Washington Tacoma, who will be graduating in the summer of 2018.
            After graduating from high school in 1999 she began pursuing a degree in Psychology from Louisiana Tech University, but after
            spending two years in the study she realized that her true interest in the subject was how humans processed information, moreover
            it was processing that had captivated her. Intrigued by how the interpretation of various stimuli could
            generate different actions in different people, caused her to change educational focuses and fueled her passion for user interface
            design. While in-between studies she held a position as a designated window display designer for the Gap; while unconventional it
            allowed her to practice the craft of designing and targeting for audience interactions. Putting to work a few of the methodologies
            learned from her studies, she was able to design window displays that attracted the attention of and drew in new customers through
            brilliantly designed stimuli. Being part of a military family made staying in one place difficult and over her travels from state
            to state she honed her design skills to create delectable treats for children, eventually forming a small business creating one off
            smash cakes. Driven by her love for design, she would pick customers brains, drawing detailed sketches and plans that ultimately
            led to small masterpieces. While she has always been artistic, it is her passion in the service of pleasing customers that truly
            comes out in her works. Eventually she found herself in Washington State and with the closing of her family’s military commitment
            she made this her home and returned to her education, with a focus on her passion of designing for human interaction. Presently
            she is enrolled in the University of Washington Tacoma and has been actively pursuing a Computer Science Degree with plans to graduate
            in the summer of 2018. Leah has the soul of an artist and the heart of a techie; designing front-end programs that are fun and exciting
            for the end user allows her to combine both worlds.</p>

                <h4>Project EMAR</h4>
                <p>Project EMAR is a National Science Foundation funded project and an interdisciplinary endeavor to investigate and effectively measure teen stress.
                    The focus of the Ecological Momentary Assessment Robot or EMAR is to exist in high schools with the purpose of understanding and managing teen stress.
                    The project is made up of a cross-campus team of researchers from the University of Washington, based out of the Tacoma and Seattle campuses.
                    The project leads are Dr. Elin Björling, an HCDE stress researcher studying adolescents, and Dr. Emma Rose, UW Tacoma Assistant Professor of Writing Studies and UX research.

                    <h4>DRG Objective</h4>
                    <p>To provide outreach education and support to groups consisting of high school teens as they develop a deeper understanding of and navigate the
                        HCD processes: develop prototypes, evaluate the emerging designs with users, and iterate based on feedback. This will culminate on March 24th 2018,
                        where these groups will take part in a Social Robot Design Challenge showcase at the Seattle UW campus and they will present their designs to the public
                        as well as a panel of experts from the industry. At this showcase the DRG team will collect data for the upcoming quarter where the team will focus on
                        qualitative data analysis in their efforts to design a social robot for teens.  This data will help the Project EMAR team make decisions about how the robot will move,
                        what it will say, and what it might look like. By having teens design a robot for themselves the team will be able to gain insight on what choices the teens made and why.

                        <h4>Project Outline</h4>
                        <p>Leah and four DRG teammates facilitated the design challenge through weekly outreach workshops at Oakland Alternative High School in Tacoma, Wa. In preparation for the weekly workshops Leah developed
                            PowerPoint presentations on various HCD topics to be covered, and each week she would steer the team to focus on a different step in the process, to ensure a holistic view of the HCD process.
                            The processes are broken down below.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>User Research: Focus on researching what participants and other Oakland students would look for in a stress relieving robot</li>
                                <li>Ideation: Brainstorm many different ideas that will focus on the features and constraints of the robots</li>
                                <li>Prototyping: Bringing designs and ideas to life</li>
                                <li>Testing: External prototype testing and feedback reception</li>
                                <li>Iteration: Make necessary adjustments based off of insight provided from testing</li>
                                <li>Design Challenge Showcase: Collect data from the student participants</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>User Research</h4>
                            <p>An icebreaker activity was initiated with the Oakland high school students asking them to share some of their loves for current technology
                                as well as what were some of their frustrations. This activity opened the door for discussion on the overall topic of human centered design,
                                but also narrowed down the conversation to the area of user research and why it is important to get quality research from a designated target
                                group before setting out on a design. The students then watched a short video on research techniques before forming into their teams to begin
                                the research phase. During this time Leah noticed that many students were unsure of the task on how to come up with research questions for the
                                design of a social robot, in fact most students had moved on to something else such as listening to music, surfing on their phone, or just plainly
                                taking a nap. The DRG team gathered for a discussion on this issue and a decision was made to switch gears from their plan. To gain some momentum it
                                was decided that the students would brainstorm as a whole, where more ideas could be generated and there would be a greater chance for enthusiasm
                                to build. While her teammates mentored ideas out of the students, Leah documented them on the white board paper so that they were visible to everyone.
                                The questions the team asked were; “What stresses you out as a teen?”, “How do you, as a teen, cope with stress?” and “What do you do to reduce stress?”
                                The students came up with a wide variety of answers on how they deal with stress. A few of the popular answers were watching Netflix, listening to music,
                                or just have someone to listen to them. Now that the students had a better understanding of the problem, the team went on to explain the steps on how do
                                we use a social robot to solve this problem. The DRG team then had the students brainstorm some questions they might ask their fellow Oakland classmates
                                on the topic. After the students had some time to formulate their research questions the DRG team went around and had the groups share out loud, and once
                                again Leah transcribed them onto the white board paper to ensure a visual reminder of the research questions for the remainder of the semester.
                                The team left the students with a task to design a feedback wall to place in a public space of the school for even more user research that could be
                                used in the further phases of the process.</p>

                                <h4>Ideation</h4>
                                <p>For this workshop Leah put together a set of PowerPoint slides that would highlight the Ideation section of the HCD process. A short video explaining
                                    what Ideation meant was played and a description of how the teens would use this step in the process of designing their social robot was briefed. The
                                    first exercise the teens took part in was empathy mapping; a way of brainstorming ideas and getting deeper insight into what the users might be seeing
                                    and feeling. The team used an empathy map that was originally created by Dave Gray and is popular with the agile community, a small example of one of
                                    the student’s empathy maps is displayed to the right. The team also had the students make an affinity diagram, which is a method that helped the teens
                                    to organize their data into groups or themes based on their relationships. The students grouped their robot features and constraints into columns and
                                    posted them in the classroom seen in the next two photos. The team also touched on two ways of sketching, either drawing your robot and its features
                                    or by storyboarding a scenario that your robot would be in. Most of the Oakland students decided on drawing their robots with features. As Leah walked
                                    around the class room she noticed a recurring theme between the various robots; music, games, food, drinks, and grade monitoring were some of the popular
                                    stress relievers that the students wanted to integrate in their designs. Below are just a few of the student robot designs that were shared with the team.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Prototyping</h4>
                                <p>For the prototyping workshop the team once again utilized a PowerPoint presentation with a short video, but also included a few examples of different robot
                                    prototypes to help the students visualize the process and maximum their own time to prototype. The students formed back into their groups and began bringing
                                    their sketches to life. Although the team planned to only take one workshop day to carry out the prototyping phase they quickly realized it was not enough
                                    so Leah and the DRG team took advantage of the small window of time remaining before class ended for the day. They made sure that the students understood
                                    the purpose of their robot prototypes and briefly explaining the next step in the process, usability testing, and how they would test their robots on other
                                    high school students to manage stress. At this point the students expressed that they were getting concerned about what the other six schools were doing and
                                    that their robots would not be good enough. The DRG team tried to put them at ease by explaining that all the schools were bringing something special to the
                                    table, including them, and not to worry what everyone else is doing. Another day of prototyping had to be added and both Chelsea and Leah had to sit down with
                                    different groups to urge them along and get them back on track. The first robot pictured, “Super Cute”, was the group Leah had been working with, and she assisted
                                    by dropping in bits and pieces of knowledge or materials to keep the creativity going. This tactic seemed to work well with her group. Below are a few of the other
                                    students in action creating their prototypes.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Testing</h4>
                                <p>Before testing, the team planned to have the students come up with three scenarios that their classmates would encounter in their school.
                                    This activity would be a crucial step for their usability tests. Though sounding fairly straight forward, the team realized quickly that
                                    this assigned task was not going as planned. They decided to switch gears again and Leah decided to sit down with the group that created
                                    “Knuckles”, pictured to the right. There were three students in the group on this particular day. One student was still working on the baby
                                    monitor feature that they would eventually use with the “Wizard of Oz” technique to simulate the robot being able to hear, talk and play music.
                                    Another student was working on something unrelated and the third student sat and listened while Leah reiterated the activity instructions.
                                    Getting no feedback Leah threw out a few scenarios for the team to ponder, knowing that a classroom was going to be in shortly to test their
                                    robot prototypes. One of these scenarios involved a student that loves music but is feeling stressed, which stirred the question of how to get
                                    Knuckles to play music and /or recognize the need to play music. She also made sure the group had a facilitator and a note taker assigned before
                                    the usability tests began. During this time the other classmates were interacting with each others groups robots, and the DRG team even got in
                                    on the action by testing the robot called “Happy” who was designed to take selfies similar to a photo booth, and even included props to use.
                                    As the workshop concluded, the team asked each group to share some feedback they received about their robot from the other classmates and what
                                    they learned from it. This information would be crucial for the next step in the HCD process. Unfortunately, this was the teams last day with
                                    the Oakland students. Leaving the last step in the hands of Mr. Sibbers, the team was confident the Oakland students would finish and be ready

                                <h4>Iteration</h4>
                                <p>The DRG team left the students with a set of instructions for the next step in the design process, iteration. They were to take the data from
                                    their usability tests and make adjustment to improve their prototype. Specifically, the DRG team asked the students to, as a group revise their
                                    notes from the usability testing session and identify at least three features that can be improved on their robot. When they have identified these
                                    features they will be able to make the necessary changes to their robot prototype.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Design Challenge Showcase</h4>
                                <p>The design challenge showcase will be set up like a science fair, during this time the student teams, one from each of the seven participating Seattle and
                                    Tacoma high schools will present their robots. The students will be asked questions about their robot prototype and will also discuss what they have learned
                                    from their experience with the design challenge in regards to teen stress and the design process. Leah will be in charge of the Oakland table and will be
                                    available to the students with any help or questions they might need or have. While the students are presenting, the DRG team will be documenting the data
                                    collected from the robot teams.</p>

                                    <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
                                    <p>The love for human centered design was what drew Leah to this project. In the end, the outreach education with the local high school ended up being the
                                        highlight for her. One significant takeaway from this project was while having a solid plan going into a workshop was a must, more importantly being
                                        able to read and adapt to the students was a necessity. Learning where that fine line between being patient and coaxing the teens to share their ideas
                                        was challenging. But most of the teens were receptive when team members would sit down with them to help out. With Oakland being an alternative high
                                        school in downtown Tacoma, teaching HCD was at times difficult as the class struggled with attendance. There would be new groups of students’ in and out
                                        over the weeks, so having a set student team from the being it would have made teaching run smoother. Overall, the small group of students that were engaged
                                        throughout this process made the outreach education worth the struggle. Being able to see the students progress from the first meeting until the last,
                                        under all of the circumstances that these teens face was inspiring.</p>

                                        <h4>Up Next</h4>
                                        <p>For the next quarter, outlined below Leah will be involved in the DRG data analysis from the showcase.</p>

                <h4>Objective</h4>
                <p>Within a group consisting of five classmates design digital support for one step of an activity using a human-centered design process and improve the experience
                    of carrying out the activity for a targeted user group of individuals.</p>

                    <h4>Project Outline</h4>
                    <p>Provide four check-ins and three deliverables within the allotted timetable.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Choose a focal activity, have users carry out this activity; interview them on their experience</li>
                        <li>Research and define a segment of under-supported users</li>
                        <li>Investigate as a group design inspiration based on existing products, and carry out targeted user research</li>

                    </ul>
                    <h4>Focal Activity</h4>
                    <p>The under-supported user group selected for this activity was individuals lacking motivation to work out. Exercising at the gym is a struggle for a large segment
                        of the population for many reasons. Discovery is necessary through research to determine how to improve this experience and create motivation.</p>

                        <h4>User Research</h4>
                        <p>Preliminary research was conducted by in-person interviews at local gyms.  The subjects were asked to be mindful of their workout activities and then document their routine.
                            This data was then turned into an experience timeline, where each step in their process was rated; creating the timeline of peaks and valleys. The valleys were in their
                            workout routine were vital to the research indicating breakdowns in motivation. All fifteen individual experiences were complied and one timeline was developed to
                            identify commonalities, shown to the right. From these findings the research questions, “What is keeping people from going to the gym?” or “What is keeping people from
                            going back to the gym?” were developed. Use of the IDEO Method Cards steered the research activities to include fly on the wall, five whys, critical incident interviews,
                            interviews, and survey methodologies. An additional 25 subjects were included in the study, but would consist of inactive gym goers, or better defined as people that do
                            have a desire to be healthy through exercising at the gym but for some reason(s) do not manage to go to the gym on a consistent basis. This user base was targeted because
                            most existing products are either designed for those already in the gym looking for exercise programs, or those looking to improve their diet in conjunction with a pre-existing
                            exercise regimen. The selection of this user base drove the creation of the how might we question, “how might we motivate people to get to the gym in the first place”, and was
                            derived from the emotional valleys cited on the experience timeline.  In an effort to answer this question a follow up interview with 5 original subjects was conducted to see if
                            they also fit into the user segment with the additional questions of, if they sometimes go to the gym to workout but don’t go as often as they would like to due to lack of motivation,
                            then what motivates them to do something they have no motivation to do.</p>

                            <h4>Design Activities</h4>
                            <p>The next step in the design process was taken from: Sprint, by Jake Knapp, Simon & Schuster, 2016. Individually the group members were to come up with design inspiration from three
                                pre-existing applications that they might base some of their designs on.  The first design activity they embarked on was lightning demos, picture shown to the right. Then they were
                                able to pick ideas from each application that they might want to consider adding to the design focus. Each of the group members followed Knapp’s four steps of divergent sketching:
                                Notes (gathered from all research thus far), Ideas (possible solutions to our design challenge), Crazy-8s (eight rapid drawings of our strongest solution), and a Solution Sketch.</p>

                                <h4>Rationale on Design Decisions</h4>
                                <p>From the individual sketches, they were able to vote and convergence on key points/details that they believed would help get the targeted users to go to the gym, see picture below.
                                    The main components of the app will be a challenge/rewards system.  From the user research, they found out that of the people in the target user group interviewed, these users would
                                    be interested in a reward based system. Reading about intrinsic motivation in Cognitive Surplus, Creativity and Generosity in a Connecter Age, by Clay Shirky gave an insight on to what
                                    really motivates people. The two main types of motivation are the desire to be autonomous and the desire to be competent.  But what happens when people’s intrinsic motivation is
                                    suppressed? That is where this app would assist. Soon the user would realize how achievable and realistic their goal and this would address the competent motivation.  Even though initially
                                    it seems like the app is taking away their autonomy at the moment of the “to gym or not to gym” question, the app will get the user to the gym and be a reminder that after their workout they
                                    will indeed feel better, it is hard to visualize that post work out feeling when one lacks motivation.  With the “challenge” the user will feel like they are part of a community and also
                                    know that they are not alone. When going to the gym becomes a habit for the user, the app will become more of a fun community based fitness challenge where rewards will be a bonus instead of
                                    the reason to get you to the gym.</p>

                                    <h4>Scenario</h4>
                                    <p>Ashanti is sitting on the couch relaxing after a long day at work just surfing the inter webs. You see, she would normally be at the gym but her lack of motivation is in full swing. But
                                        then she gets a Facebook notification from her friend Mike. He suggests she download FitRewards a new motivation fitness app. She clicks the link and it takes her to the app store and she
                                        notices it has a good rating and proceeds to download it. She is greeted with registration page where she can fill out what motivational rewards she would prefer and some of her goals.
                                        As soon as she is done registering to her surprise she already has a workout challenge from her friend Mike. Why not she thinks to herself. She gets her stuff together and heads to the gym.
                                        At the gym she is prompted to follow Mike’s workout by scanning the QR codes for workout check-ins and information on how to. When she is done with her workout she watches a short sponsored
                                        ad and rewarded with her rewards.  Since Mike challenged her he also will get the rewards, win-win!</p>

                                        <h4>Storyboard</h4>
                                        <p>After the group decided on a design, Leah created a detailed storyboard following Jake Knapp’s instructions in his chapter on storyboarding from Sprint.  Illustrated below.</p>

                                        <h4>Prototyping and Usability Testing</h4>
                                        <p>The prototyping design phase consisted of executing a technology demonstrator. I.e. PowerPoint click-through. The team collaborated on screening and recruitment procedures, as well as a testing plan followed by user testing.</p>

                <h4>Objective</h4>
                <p>For her Individual Design Challenge, she decided on designing a mobile application geared towards children older than kindergarteners that are struggling with learning sight words due to a learning disability.
                    Having a child with an auditory and or a visual processing disability makes sight word learning a challenge. Children with dyslexia for instance, can have extra difficulty learning these high frequency sight words.
                    Sight words are words that usually do not follow standard spelling words, so these words are not easily decodable. It is important to know and recognize these high frequency words to be able to be a quick fluent reader.
                    Given her experience with this topic she has decided to start the sketching process. A few years back she had done quite a bit of research on applications, tips, and tricks with helping to facilitate sight word
                    recognition for her son who has Dyslexia. To this day she still struggles to find age appropriate flash card applications. She has talked to a few other mothers that also have been looking for an app that has less
                    bells and whistles that ultimately detract from the learning task at hand. Most of the applications for sight words are geared to a younger age group and had silly juvenile games. Designing an age appropriate high
                    frequency sight word flash card system is the challenge she will tackle. Following Jake Knapp’s sketching process, the first step to sketching was to gather notes. Previous Google searches on Dyslexia lead to a blog,
                    usabilla.com/how-to-design-for-dyslexia/. Some of the main tools that can be helpful for dyslexics were discussed. For example, the type of font used is crucial because some fonts add hooks to some letters.
                    Other fonts will have the letters to close together, spacing is important. Additionally, the color of the words and even the color of the back ground could be problematic. Black words on a white background can be
                    difficult for some dyslexics when trying to read. Another article important to the research was, learning sight words though “beat”. This would be a nice addition to the sight word application adding a new dimension to
                    sight word repetition. The second step in the sketching process was spent on drawing up rough ideas and writing down what ever came to mind after gathering and looking over notes. The third step in this process was to
                    do the Crazy 8s activity. This is a short exercise that will build on the idea sketches form the previous step. Take about one minute per sketch and try to pinpoint what exactly might work well in this mobile application.
                    After the Crazy 8s, you move on to the last step, which is the Solution Sketch. These will be the best ideas from the last step, with an even more in depth look at some of the ideas. Pictured below.</p>

                    <h4>Scenario</h4>
                    <p>It’s a Monday afternoon; the kids are just getting in the door from a long day at school. It is Sean’s third week of 2nd grade. As he walks to the fridge to grab an after school snack, his mom asked where are his new sight
                        words for the week. He groans as he walks back to his backpack to retrieve the new stack of sight words and holds them out to her. His mom asked him to cut out the new words and add them to the stack from the previous
                        weeks that he has not yet mastered. She reminds him that sight word flash cards are an important repetition tool for learning new words. But in the case with Sean, sight words are the bane of his existence.
                        The reason for this is because Sean has a learning disability that affects his ability to quickly identify these words. What usually takes a 2nd grader about week to learn the sight word list, it takes Sean about a week
                        to learn maybe one or two of these words. As the weeks go by, the flash card stack gets larger and larger and the paper cards get tattered and torn. Sean’s mom is also tired of caring abound the plastic baggy even where
                        they go, she thinks there must be an easier way to have all these sight words in one place. She heads the app store on her phone and types in sight words. She found many over complicated word game apps or apps geared to
                        kindergartners. Among all of the other apps she sees Sight Word Flash Cards with a good rating and it looks fairly simple, she downloads it. When the app opens up she is meet with three buttons, where she can click the word
                        button to add words. There is also an option to add her own voice for a playback if her son need help on a word if she is not around while he is practicing. There a two modes to the mobile app. Flash card mode where you randomly
                        get shown a word from the word list or the metronome mode where a list of words will be displayed and the metronome beat will turn on and with every beat you say each word in order of the bold faced multi-colored word going in
                        different patterns to help with repetition. Both mother and son are much happier with this simplistic version of sight word flash cards and no longer have to cut out, keep track of and carry around those horrible stacks of cards again. </p>
